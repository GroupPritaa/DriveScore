# DriveScore Project Description

DriveScore: Privacy-preserving blockchain platform for driving safety assessment using FHEVM encryption technology.

DriveScore is a privacy-preserving blockchain-based driving safety assessment platform powered by Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine (FHEVM) technology. The platform enables users to securely record and analyze driving performance scores (0-100) on-chain while maintaining complete data privacy.

Built on Ethereum-compatible networks, DriveScore encrypts all scores using FHEVM, allowing trend analysis, average calculations, and statistical aggregations to be performed directly on encrypted data without decryption. Users can track continuous safe driving days, visualize performance trends, and maintain comprehensive driving history—all while ensuring sensitive data remains confidential. The platform features an intuitive dark-themed web interface with dashboard analytics, score submission, and data visualization capabilities.
